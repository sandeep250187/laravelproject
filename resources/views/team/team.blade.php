                       <p style="text-align: justify;">Here’s your chance to go back to your school days and compete in all the old favorites’ of a school sports day team building event. If you never got to participate in the egg and spoon race, the wheelbarrow race or the old favorites school sports day games, now is the time to do it. Or if you always came first and were the resident school hero this is your opportunity to prove to yourself you’re not over the hill!<br>This event is a brilliant form of fun team building where fun and laughter are in abundance. Your group will be split into teams who will compete against each other on the different school sports day games throughout the tournament. All the games would be controlled by the compeer/ head master and his set of safety instructors/school prefects who would explain all the rules, make sure everybody stuck to them and also keep score throughout the event.</p>
