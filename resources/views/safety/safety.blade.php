                        <li>The most important thing is to be mentally prepared and excited about the sport you are attempting. Ask yourself if you actually want to do it or is it just peer pressure. Go ahead only if you are confident.</li>
                        <li>If you suffer from vertigo, acrophobia, asthma or any heart disease, refrain from attempting such sports. Make sure that you are in pink of health and in case of minor ailments, take your doctor’s advice. Consider doing an activity in tandem with a friend or a family member to give you more confidence. </li>
                        <li>Follow everything that your trainers say to avoid any unforeseen situation. Ensure that you are not making too much noise and the trainer is audible enough for everyone.</li>
                        <li>At times of sudden thrust or fall, you may temporarily injure your knees, elbows and other body parts. Ensure that you are wearing proper safety gear. Don’t forget your helmet. Wear appropriate protective padding, if possible. This could include knees pads, elbow pads and wrist pads.</li>
                        <li>) A proper warm-up is needed to keep muscles and joints flexible. Be sure to warm-up the muscles you’ll be working.</li>
                        <li>Don’t wear clothes that have chances of tearing or that may be uncomfortable while doing the sport.</li>
                        <li>Don’t take pictures while doing the sport. It can be extremely dangerous. Focus on what you are there for and make the best out of it.</li>
                        <li>) It’s better when you do it along with a friend or a family member. It not only gives you more confidence while attempting it, but in case of an unforeseen situation, having someone you can count on, can be very helpful.</li>
                        <li>Check about the company before you risk your life, ask as many questions as possible about their high safety and risk management procedures. Choose a company that has been in the business for a while and is popular among the masses.</li>
                        <li>Before you opt for any adventure sport, make sure you carry a valid photo ID with yourself to prove your age.</li>
                        
                      </ul>

                      <h2>More safety tips for your adventure holiday</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Safety gear is another factor which should be considered before participating in adventure sports. Life jackets, helmets, padding are all extremely important. Do not try to cut costs when you invest in these. There are several places where you will be able to rent high-quality safety equipment as well, if you are sure that you will not need the equipment again. Regardless of whether you decide to buy or rent, always ensure that you have all the correct safety gear in good condition and know how to operate them.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Regardless of whether you decide to buy or rent, always ensure that you have all the correct safety gear in good condition and know how to operate them. Also, do not forget to consider natural factors before embarking on your adventure holiday. Avoid any type of adventure holiday during the monsoons. Wear appropriate clothing and avoid wearing jewellery or other accessories. As with most sports, a proper warm up and stretching is important to loosen your muscles and joints before starting.</p>
